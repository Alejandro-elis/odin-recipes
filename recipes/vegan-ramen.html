        <h3> What is Ramen? </h3>
            <p>It's a traditional Japanese noodle soup that is made of wheat or egg noodles, meat or fish broth, and an assortment of veggies and toppings.  There are several varieties depending on the regional origin.</p>
            <p> There are also different types of broth flavoring used as well. Some of the most popular are Shoyu (soy sauce-based), Shio (salted), Kare (curry-based), and Miso.</p>
            <p> Miso is a classic Japanese seasoning made of fermented soybeans mixed with koji and salt. It gives a salty umami taste that you will commonly find as the base of most Japanese dishes. </p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.</b> Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, then sauté until fragrant and the onion is golden. About 5-6 minutes.</li>
                <li><b>Now add in the vegetable broth, water, tamari, and dried mushroom.</b> Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 35-40 minutes.</li>
                <li><b>Start preparing the tofu.</b> In a container with a lid, add the tofu cubes, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Close the lid and gently shake until the tofu is well coated.</li>
                <li><b>Heat up sesame oil in a large skillet</b> then place the tofu in an even layer and cook for 2-4 minutes on each side until the cubes are golden and crispy.</li>
                <li><b>When the broth is done,</b> pour it through a fine-mesh strainer with a big bowl underneath and press the mixture with the back of a large spoon to release all the broth. Reserve the mushroom for serving and discard the rest.</li>
                <li><b>Pour broth back into the pot,</b> but take out a ½ cup of broth and place it in a small bowl with the miso paste. Whisk well to combine and add it back into the broth.</li>
                <li><b>Bring the pot of broth to a boil,</b> then add the baby bok choy and cook for 1-2 minutes to blanch. Remove with tongs and set aside.</li>
                <li><b>Add the noodles and cook for 2-4 minutes</b> until you’ve reached the desired consistency. To serve, use tongs or chopsticks to divide the noodles between 4 bowls and ladle the broth on top. Add the tofu, mushrooms, bok choy, carrots, green onion, chopped cilantro.</li>
            </ol>
