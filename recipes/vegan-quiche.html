            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>For a winning breakfast or brunch, serve this Easy Vegan Quiche to a hungry crowd. The filling is packed with flavor from sautéed onions, garlic, and browned mushrooms. It calls for a pre-made pie crust to make it easier!</p>
                <p>We're having Easter brunch at our house this year and I'm already planning on easy recipes to serve. I like to serve food that is satisfying but won't keep me in the kitchen for hours.</p>
                <p>This Vegan Quiche is on the menu along with this Black Bean Corn Salad and Vegan Crab Bites. Plus, fresh OJ for the littles and mimosas for the big kids!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Onions</li>
                    <li>Mushrooms</li>
                    <li>Spinach</li>
                    <li>Tofu</li>
                    <li>Vegan Pie Crust</li>
                    <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Garlic</li>
                    <li>black Salt</li>
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>Non-Dairy Milk</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Sauté onions</b> until softened and lightly browned. Add garlic and sauté until lightly golden and fragrant.</li>
                    <li><b>Now add mushrooms</b> and sauté until softened and browned.</li>
                    <li><b>Add spinach</b> and cook until just wilted. Sprinkle with salt & pepper if desired and remove from heat.</li>
                    <li><b>Break up tofu</b> and add it to a Food Processor along with the seasonings, 1 tablespoon of milk, and flour. Process until the mixture is smooth. It will be very thick, but if it won't smooth out, you can add 1 more tablespoon of milk - just enough to get in moving.</li>
                    <li><b>Place quiche filling into a medium mixing bowl</b> and fold in the mushroom/spinach mixture. Add the filling to the pie crust and spread out evenly with a spatula. Place the cut tomatoes on top and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes until the filling firms up and is golden on top. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
                </ol>
