# odin-recipes
A simple recipe website project to learn how to build a website and use Git. 

## What is the aim of this project?
This is a project proposed in the course of "The Odin Project".

Through this project I hope not only to start learning how to use Git in a more autonomous and realistic environment, being able to decide by myself when and how to make the commits, but also to see how far I am able to go with the little and basic things I have learnt during the course so far.

The first phases of the project will be HTML only, but I expect to work on the style and dynamism of the web as I learn more about CSS and Javascript during the course.

A recipe page project is not entirely new to me, as I already built a similar project on my notion.so profile in the past (not really building it from zero, but adapting it from other people's templates). It can be seen here: https://sour-windflower-b94.notion.site/71d5b461a52944499e880cf1482e4434?v=58d9bd6a826e4f548579b40b8ac4ad96 

## Feedback messages üéÅ
I welcome any feedback you can give me on my project, on the form and content of this readme.md, or on my commits.
